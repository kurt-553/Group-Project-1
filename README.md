# Team XX project repository

(this is an example file, replace the contents as appropriate)

When tidying up the repository for submission, please make sure that everything is well labelled and organised, otherwise it will be difficult for the markers to understand the structure of your work. If you have multiple copies of your code (old versions, etc), please keep them separate to the "lab_pc" and "embedded" folders.
